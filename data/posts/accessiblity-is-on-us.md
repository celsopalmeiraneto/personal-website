As any parent knows, kids get sick, especially when they are of young age, and sometimes it's
troublesome to give them medicines. Me, the adult in the room, usually say: "Common... It's not that bad"
and proceed to give myself a small dose or taste it.

This time around it was **that bad**.

The medication in question was Atropocil (brand name in the Portuguese market), the main substance is
Atropine Sulfate, which was prescribed to my child before an eye exam. Half an hour after "experimenting"
it, my eyes felt funny. On the following day I realized I made a mistake, I could only see things further
than a meter and my eyes were hyper sensitive to lights.

## Failures of Font Scaling

### iOS

Since I could still see and read from the distance, I started changing my accessibility settings.

Finding the right accessibility settings was challenging. My wife was not home, and at that moment,
I wondered if Siri could have helped me a bit more with such task.

Using the Apple's apps like Message or Mail was easy. All content was responsive to my new system settings
and making it possible to read.

The experience with other apps was mixed. My own (grain of salt: I don't work on the mobile team) Shares app
worked well, most text was responsive to my system settings, on the other hand, apps like the BPI or
Bankinter (two banks that operate in Portugal) were impossible. To make things more difficult, some apps
that use MFA in the app (i.e.: to login on the browser), were only usable with iOS' zoom feature.

### Browsers

The next step was ensuring that I could join my meetings, check my calendar or boot a VM. I was lucky
that many of the services I rely on have a "traditional" web presence through browsers.

The flexibility of the browsers was essential for the work I was doing. Pretty much all I had
to do was turning on the zoom feature to 140% by default and voilá, most things were readable.

I should offer a big props to GitHub, where I perform my PR evaluations and also use Copilot Agents. It shows that
even content dense applications can be highly accessible.

### Coding

On the subject of code, using VSCode and Terminal was not a problem. Customizing fonts, font sizes and
themes is a feature that has always been there made working possible.

## The Necessity of Dark Mode

This was the feature that made so much difference in the height of my vision issues. Even though, many times,
when colleagues said that dark mode was an accessibility feature, one side of me always thought that
people were justifying their preferences using accessibility.

I was wrong.

As brightness was an issue, using the dark mode together with large fonts was extremely helpful, and, while in the browsers
I could use the Dark Reader extension to force dark mode, on the iOS Apps I had no choice. Looking at those white
screens really hurt and I could do that only for a couple of seconds until I had to look somewhere else.

Thankfully, even when being forced to look at those small fonts and white backgrounds, I most of the time
knew where to look at.

## Familiarity and Physical Safety

Familiarity helped me a lot, both on the real world and on the virtual one.

Knowing where to find some phone settings, or where to click to do something helped me so much. Even though I
could not clearly read what was written on that orange button with white text, I knew I had to click there.

Our brain is a powerful machine and those moments made me realize that we don't actually see all there is. That's
exactly how magicians perform, they use the "fill in the blanks" our brains do to save energy and move fast, and, on
my case, I could just navigate through the world easily.

## Takeaway

We as developers have serious influence on how our users are impacted by our work. Visual impairments can happen
to all of us, temporarily or not, and with the tooling we have for web and apps development, caring for some basic
accessibility features don't add much to the overall work.

Familiarity is important and we should not be moving things all the time in our apps. Even small, poorly thought changes
can cause serious issues. Imagine if we switch the colors or positions of the "Cancel" and "Confirm" in a highly
used screen.

And last, let's be curious, not reactive. Next time around, Celso, don't brush off people's point, that's hubris and ignorance.
