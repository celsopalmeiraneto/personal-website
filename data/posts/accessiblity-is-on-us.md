As any parent knows, kids get sick, especially when they are of a young age, and sometimes it's troublesome to give them medicine.
I, the adult in the room, usually say: "Come on... It's not that bad" and proceed to give myself a small dose or taste it.

This time around it was **that bad**.

The medication was based on Atropine Sulfate, which was prescribed to my child before an eye exam. Half an hour after "experimenting"
it, my eyes felt funny. On the following day I realized I made a mistake; I could only see things further than a meter,
and my eyes were hypersensitive to light.

## Failures of Font Scaling

### iOS

Since I could still see and read from the distance, I started changing my accessibility settings.

Finding the right settings was challenging. My wife was not home, and at that moment,
I wondered if Siri could have helped me a bit more with such a task.

Using Apple's apps like Message or Mail was easy. All content was responsive, making it possible to read.

The experience with other apps was mixed. My own (grain of salt: I don't work on the mobile team) Shares app
worked well, most text was responsive to my system settings, on the other hand, apps like the BPI or
Bankinter (two banks that operate in Portugal) were impossible. To make things more difficult, some apps
that use MFA in the app (i.e. to log in on the browser) were only usable with iOS' zoom feature.

### Browsers

The next step was ensuring that I could join my meetings, check my calendar, or boot a VM. I was lucky
that many of the services I rely on have a "traditional" web presence through browsers.

The flexibility of the browsers was essential for the work I was doing.
Pretty much all I had to do was turn on the zoom feature to 140% by default and voilà, most things were readable.

I should offer big props to GitHub, where I perform my PR evaluations and also use Copilot Agents.
It shows that even applications with dense content can be highly accessible.

### Coding

Regarding code, using VSCode and Terminal was not a problem. Customizing fonts, font sizes and
themes are features that are as old as Notepad++ and have always been there.

## The Necessity of Dark Mode

This feature made so much difference. Even though, many times,
when colleagues said that dark mode was an accessibility need, one side of me always thought that
people were justifying their preferences.

I was wrong.

As brightness was an issue, using the dark mode together with large fonts was extremely helpful, and, while in the browsers
I could use the Dark Reader extension to force dark mode, on the iOS apps I had no choice. Looking at those white screens really hurt,
and I could do that only for a couple of seconds until I had to look somewhere else.

Thankfully, even when being forced to look at those small fonts and white backgrounds, I most of the time
knew where to look at.

## Familiarity and Physical Safety

Familiarity helped me a lot, in both real and virtual worlds.

Knowing where to find some phone settings, or where to click to do something helped me so much. Even though I
could not clearly read what was written on that orange button with white text, I knew I had to click there.

Our brain is a powerful machine, and those moments made me realize that we don't see all there is. We see what’s focused; the rest is filling the gaps.

## Takeaway

We as developers have a serious influence on how our users are impacted by our work. Visual impairments can happen to all of us, temporarily or not, and with the tooling we have for web and app development, caring for basic accessibility features won't derail the delivery of good software.

Familiarity is important and we should not be moving things all the time in our apps. Even small, poorly thought changes can cause serious issues. Imagine if we switch the colors or positions of the "Cancel" and "Confirm" in a highly used screen.

And last, let's be curious, not reactive. Next time around, Celso, don't brush off someone's points, that's hubris and ignorance.
