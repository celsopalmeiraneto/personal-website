As Tech Leader I helped nurturing new talent, designing solutions, and be the liaison between business and technology. In an environment that strived for quality and pace, we managed to often find a balance between those seemly paradoxical requisites."

In AWS we started using EC2 together with ECS and Docker for application scaling, EBS for load balancing, RDS for the Postgres database, CloudFront for CDN, S3 for static assets hosting, SNS and SES and to deliver messages to the users. By using the new infrastructure ONEGRID was able to handle millions of monthly requests."
